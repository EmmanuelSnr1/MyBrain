Certainly! Let's break down the problem and visualize the architecture of the system you'll build. We'll outline the use cases, the system architecture, and the steps to implement the solution.

System Overview
Data Ingestion and Storage:

CSV Import: Import your CSV data into a MySQL database using Hibernate.
API Integration: Use the Companies House API to fetch employee history and store this data in your database.
Backend Implementation:

Java Jersey: Create RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations and queries.
Hibernate: Map your database tables to Java entities for ORM.
Frontend Implementation:

Vue.js: Build a user interface to interact with the data, display company information, and filter companies based on employee size and history.
Example Use Cases
Import CSV Data:

Admin uploads a CSV file containing company information.
The system parses the CSV and stores the data in the MySQL database.
Fetch and Store Employee History:

A scheduled task queries the Companies House API for employee history of each company.
The fetched data is stored in the database.
Filter Companies by Employee Size:

User selects a range (e.g., 20-50 employees).
The system queries the database for companies within the specified range and displays the results.
View Company Details:

User clicks on a company to view detailed information, including employee history over the past 10 years.
System Architecture
Database (MySQL):

Tables for Company, EmployeeHistory, and any other relevant entities.
Relationships between tables defined using Hibernate.
Backend (Java Jersey + Hibernate):

RESTful APIs to handle data operations.
Scheduled tasks for periodic API calls to Companies House.
Frontend (Vue.js):

Components for uploading CSV, displaying company lists, filtering options, and detailed views.
Implementation Steps
Database Schema Design:

Create tables for Company, EmployeeHistory, etc.
Define relationships and indexes for efficient querying.
CSV Data Import:

Write a service to parse CSV files and store data using Hibernate.
Ensure data validation and error handling.
API Integration:

Develop a service to interact with the Companies House API.
Implement logic to fetch and store employee history data.
Backend Endpoints:

Create RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on companies and employee history.
Implement filtering logic based on employee size ranges.
Frontend Development:

Build components for data upload, display, and filtering.
Use Vue.js to create dynamic and responsive interfaces.
Example Code Snippets
CSV Import Service (Java)
java
Copy code
public class CSVImportService {

    @Autowired
    private CompanyRepository companyRepository;

    public void importCSV(File csvFile) throws IOException {
        List<Company> companies = parseCSV(csvFile);
        companyRepository.saveAll(companies);
    }

    private List<Company> parseCSV(File csvFile) throws IOException {
        List<Company> companies = new ArrayList<>();
        // Parse CSV logic here
        return companies;
    }
}
Employee History Fetching Service (Java)
java
Copy code
public class EmployeeHistoryService {

    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/";

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeHistoryRepository employeeHistoryRepository;

    public void fetchAndStoreEmployeeHistory(String companyId) {
        // Call API and get employee history
        List<EmployeeHistory> histories = fetchEmployeeHistoryFromAPI(companyId);
        employeeHistoryRepository.saveAll(histories);
    }

    private List<EmployeeHistory> fetchEmployeeHistoryFromAPI(String companyId) {
        // API call logic here
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
RESTful Endpoint Example (Java)
java
Copy code
@Path("/companies")
public class CompanyResource {

    @Autowired
    private CompanyService companyService;

    @GET
    @Path("/filter")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response filterCompanies(@QueryParam("minSize") int minSize, @QueryParam("maxSize") int maxSize) {
        List<Company> companies = companyService.filterByEmployeeSize(minSize, maxSize);
        return Response.ok(companies).build();
    }
}
Vue.js Component Example
vue
Copy code
<template>
  <div>
    <input type="number" v-model="minSize" placeholder="Min Size">
    <input type="number" v-model="maxSize" placeholder="Max Size">
    <button @click="filterCompanies">Filter</button>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="company in companies" :key="company.id">
        {{ company.name }} ({{ company.employeeSize }} employees)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      minSize: 0,
      maxSize: 0,
      companies: []
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async filterCompanies() {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/companies/filter?minSize=${this.minSize}&maxSize=${this.maxSize}`);
      this.companies = await response.json();
    }
  }
};
</script>
Flexibility and Scalability
Modular Design: Keep services and components modular to allow easy maintenance and scalability.
Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.
Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
API Rate Limits: Respect API rate limits by implementing throttling and retry mechanisms.
By following these steps and considerations, you can build a flexible and scalable system to manage and analyze company data efficiently. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of the implementation, feel free to ask!
